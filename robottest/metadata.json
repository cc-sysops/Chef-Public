  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nUse this cookbook to distribute your tests to the target systems and run them there.\n\nThe cookbook has yet only been tested on / implemented for Debian/Ubuntu. Furthermore,\ncurrenty it's currently not possible to include libs with pybot/jybot, but it's a\nsmall thing and will be done in the next version. Of course, contribution is very\nwelcome.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nTo use this cookbook, you need:\n\nrobot (with all its dependencies)\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nrunner - \"j\" or \"p\" as in \"jybot\" / \"pybot\"  \nurlbase - the HTTP base path where to get test archives from  \narchive - the name of the tar.gz file which contains all test relevant files  \ntest - test spec file to run, relative to the .. of the tar base folder  \n\nUsage\n=====\n\nWhat you can do with it? You need to know about acceptance test automation and how they\nare implemented/supported by the Robot Framework. When you know this, you will also know\nthat acceptance tests can be very slow. If you have a chance to run parts of your whole\nsuites on different machines in parallel, this cookbook will help you do so.\n",
