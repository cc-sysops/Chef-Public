# <a name="title"></a> chef-openoffice [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fnichol/chef-openoffice.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fnichol/chef-openoffice)

## <a name="description"></a> Description

Installs the OpenOffice productivity suite.

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

Simply include `recipe[openoffice::headless]` to install OpenOffice headlessly
and include `recipe[openoffice::apps]` to install the OpenOffice application components.

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

### <a name="requirements-chef"></a> Chef

Tested on 10.12.0 but newer and older version should work just fine.
File an [issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

### <a name="requirements-platform"></a> Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu

Please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.

### <a name="requirements-cookbooks"></a> Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [java][java_cb] (Opscode)

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

### <a name="installation-platform"></a> From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install openoffice

### <a name="installation-librarian"></a> Using Librarian-Chef

[Librarian-Chef][librarian] is a bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a [Cheffile][cheffile] and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install Librarian-Chef:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init

To use the Opscode platform version:

    echo "cookbook 'openoffice'" >> Cheffile
    librarian-chef install

Or to reference the Git version:

    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'openoffice',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice.git', :ref => 'v0.2.2'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

### <a name="installation-kgc"></a> Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-openoffice/v0.2.2

### <a name="installation-tarball"></a> As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice/tarball/v0.2.2 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-openoffice-* openoffice

### <a name="installation-gitsubmodule"></a> As a Git Submodule

A dated practice (which is discouraged) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice.git cookbooks/openoffice
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## <a name="recipes"></a> Recipes

### <a name="recipes-default"></a> default

This recipe is a no-op and does nothing.

### <a name="recipes-headless"></a> headless

Installs the headless (no X) core of OpenOffice.

### <a name="recipes-apps"></a> apps

Installs the application components for OpenOffice, namely Writer, Calc, and Impress.

## <a name="attributes"></a> Attributes

There are **no** configurable attributes in this cookbook.

## <a name="lwrps"></a> Resources and Providers

## <a name="development"></a> Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.
Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
