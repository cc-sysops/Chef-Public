  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls and configures [strongSwan IPsec](http://strongswan.org/). By\ndefault it creates a meshed, host-to-host network with a single,\nshared secret.\n\n*Warning*: This cookbook is a proof-of-concept. It has not been\nvalidated to provide _any_ actual security and may damage your\nnetwork beyond repair. Use at your own risk!\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* Tested on Ubuntu 10.04\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node[:ipsec][:shared_secret]` - defaults to \"my_insecure_secret\"\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nBy including the default recipe this cookbook will search for all\nnodes with the ipsec recipe in their run list and configure\nhost-to-host connections between each.\n\nAll nodes use the same shared secret for simplicity. You may want to\ninvestigate different authentication implementations if a more\ncomplete security system is important for your organization.\n",
