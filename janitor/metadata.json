You could also apply some criteria to the files\nthat are targeted such as glob patterns, age, and size.\n\nRequirements\n============\nChef, Linux\n\nActions\n=======\n\n:purge\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n  Purge the files in the directory as either the resource name,\n  or the path attribute to the janitor_directory LWRP\n  Can also apply criteria such age file age, file size\n  \nAttributes\n==========\nNo attributes are required for the use of this cookbook\n\nUsage\n=====\nAn LWRP \"janitor_directory\" is provided for declaring a directory\nfor which to search in and purge files in that directory.\nSome criteria can also be supplied to include an age and size threshold.\n\nLWRP\n----\n\njanitor\\_directory\n--------------\n\n### Parameters:\n\n* `path` - Resource name or path parameter will pass the path to be examined to the lwrp\n* `include_files` - Array of glob patterns of files to include in the search criteria\n* `exclude_files` - Array of glob patterns of files to exclude in the search criteria\n* `age` - The age in days of files to include in the search criteria\n* `size` - The size of files to include in the search criteria\n* `recursive` - enable recursive searching from the path indicated in the resource\n\nExamples\n========\n\nDelete all files in /tmp with the .log extension\n\n    janitor_directory \"/tmp\" do\n      include_files [\"*.log\"]\n      action        :purge\n    end\n\nThis will delete all files with the .log extension in /tmp\n\n    janitor_directory \"/tmp\" do\n      include_files [\"*.log\"]\n      action        :purge\n    end\n\nDelete all files in the /var/log directory recursively that are larger than 1 MegaByte\n\n    janitor_directory \"/var/log\" do\n      include_files [\"*.log\"]\n      size          \"1M\"\n      recursive\t    true\n      action        :purge\n    end\n\nDelete all files in the /var/log directory recursively that are older than 5 days\n\n    janitor_directory \"/var/log\" do\n      include_files\t[\"*.log\"]\n      age           5\n      recursive     true\n      action        :purge\n    end\n\n\n","maintainer":"Mark Pimentel","maintainer_email":"markpimentel22@gmail.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"0.0.5"}
