Automatically switches from UDP to TCP as well.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\nFirst, make sure you set the `['logentries']['token']` attribute in your Role/Environment\nto the token created in Logentries for your input. Then include the `logentries::default`\nrecipe in you run list to start streaming all syslog entries to Logentries.\n\n### Tailing log files\nThis functionality is currently not available, but will be provided via the Opscode Rsyslog cookbook\n(included as a dependency), where there is an open pull request for it at the time of this writing.\n\n\nDevelopment\n============\nPlease refer to the Readme [here](https://github.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/cookbook-development/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Adam Borocz ([on GitHub](https://github.com/motns))\n\nCopyright:: 2013, HipSnip Ltd.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
