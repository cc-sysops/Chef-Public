When it finds a CSR, it signs it and places the resulting public key in a directory exposed by rsync. \nSince these are public keys, there are no security concerns here.\n\nWhen a client is satisfied about its certificate, it will remove the attribute.\n\n* https://github.com/someara/pki-cookbook\n",
