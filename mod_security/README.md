Description
===========

Ever wanted a little guardian angel to protect your chef deployed
servers from the bad guys?  Like a bad-ass Jiminy Cricket on your
shoulder?  

This package is to make deployment and testing of mod_security easier
with chef.  Right now it centers entirely around the OWASP Core Rule
Sets of mod_security rules.  In future, it will allow you to manage/deploy
custom rule/rulesets of your own.

There are 2 main use cases right now:

## Install on a real production server

* Adjust the attributes to your liking and install the default
  recipe.  
  
## Find out what ModSecurity could do for your site in less than
   15-minutes.
   
* Setup a base chef recipe for a server.  Ubuntu 10.04 on Rackspace
  Cloud is pretty easy (and what I've tested with)
* Set it to install the default recipe
* Create a cookbook to reverse proxy to your real server sorta like
  this:
<pre>  
mod_secure_proxy "my_site" do
  server_name "www.mysite.com"
  enable_https true # if you want to proxy https too
end
</pre>
* Set your local /etc/hosts (or equiv.) file to have that server's IP
  look like your site
* Test to your heart's content.
* Look at /var/log/modsec.log and see what you could be blocking
* Change the "DetectOnly" attribute to "On" and test some more

Requirements
============

## Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on apache2 and build-essential

## Platforms

### Supported
* Ubuntu (tested on 10.04)
* Debian
* RedHat
* CentOS (tested on 5.6)
* Fedora
* Scientific?

### Coming Soon
* Arch (anything else that apache2 supports)

Attributes
==========

Major ones will be documented soon.  For right now check the
attributes file.  A few suggestions

* Compile from source.  I normally prefer not to do this, but some
  core rules break if you don't
* The core rules are in the cookbook because old version seem to
  disappear from sourceforge, and that sucks if you're maintaining a
  large deployment.  
* Base rules should generally be safe.  the other groups much less
  so. There are some rules with inconsistently named data files that
  will need to be fixed.
