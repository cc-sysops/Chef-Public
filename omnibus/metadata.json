{"name":"omnibus","description":"Prepares a machine to be an Omnibus builder.","long_description":"omnibus Cookbook\n================\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/omnibus.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/omnibus)\n\nPrepares a machine to be an Omnibus builder.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n### Chef\n- Chef 11.0.0+\n\n### Platform\nSupported platforms by platform family:\n\n- debian (debian, ubuntu)\n- fedora\n- freebsd\n- rhel (centos, redhat, amazon, scientific etc.)\n- smartos\n- solaris2\n- windows\n\n### Cookbooks\nThis cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:\n\n- [apt](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apt) (Opscode)\n- [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) (Opscode)\n- [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) (Opscode)\n- [homebrew](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/homebrew) (Opscode)\n- [pkgutil](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/pkgutil) (marthag)\n- [rbenv](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/rbenv) (Riot Games)\n- [yum](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/yum) (Opscode)\n- [wix](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/wix) (Opscode)\n- [7-zip](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/7-zip) (Opscode)\n\nRecipes\n-------\nThe default recipe is the main entrypoint for the cookbook and does the following:\n\n- Ensures all required Omnibus-related directories are created and owned by the build user.\n- Ensures a sane build tool-chain is installed and configured (using the [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) cookbook)\n- Ensures git is installed (using the [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) cookbook)\n- Includes a platform-specific recipe to apply additional tweaks as appropriate.\n\nAll other recipes should be treated as \"private\" and are not meant to be used individually. They only exist to support the `default` recipe.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Attribute</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <th>Type</th>\n    <th>Default</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>build_user</td>\n    <td>User Omnibus build will be performed as</td>\n    <td>String</td>\n    <td>omnibus</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>install_dir</td>\n    <td>Installation directory of the Omnibus package</td>\n    <td>String</td>\n    <td>/opt/omnibus</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>cache_dir</td>\n    <td>The directory the Omnibus project uses for caching</td>\n    <td>String</td>\n    <td>/var/cache/omnibus</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nInclude the `omnibus::default` recipe in your node's run list and override the cookbook's default attributes as desired. At the very least you will want to override `node['omnibus']['install_dir']` to match the installation directory of your Omnibus project.\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@opscode.com>)\n- Author:: Stephen Delano (<stephen@opscode.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright 2012-2013, Opscode, Inc.
