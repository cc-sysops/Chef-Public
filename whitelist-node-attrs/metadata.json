  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook provides a library that allows you to set a whitelist of\nnode attributes that should be saved on the server. All of the\nattributes are still available throughout the chef run, but only those\nspecifically listed will be saved to the server.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nChef 0.9.0+\n\nRequires chef-client and a Chef Server - this cookbook doesn't make\nsense, nor work, with chef-solo.\n\nWorks on any platform.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n`node[:whitelist]` provides a map of node attributes to store. The\ndefaults are provided by this cookbook, and the map is:\n\n    node.default[:whitelist] = {\n      \"domain\" => true,\n      \"fqdn\" => true,\n      \"hostname\" => true,\n      \"ipaddress\" => true,\n      \"macaddress\" => true,\n      \"platform\" => true,\n      \"platform_version\" => true,\n      \"kernel\" => {\n        \"machine\" => true,\n        \"name\" => true,\n        \"os\" => true,\n        \"release\" => true,\n        \"version\" => true\n      }\n    }\n\nThis cookbook honors the fact that attributes are set at different\nprecedence levels.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nUpload the cookbook, and make sure that it is included as a dependency\nin another cookbooks metadata, or that the recipe (which does nothing)\nis included in the role.\n\nWhenever node.save is called, such as at the end of the run, the\nwhitelist will be applied.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Adam Jacob (<adam@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2011-2012, Opscode, Inc (<legal@opscode.com>)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
