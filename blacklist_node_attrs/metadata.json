  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook provides a library that allows you to set a blacklist of\nnode attributes that should not be saved on the server. All of the\nattributes are still available throughout the chef run, but those\nspecifically listed will not be saved to the server.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nChef 0.9.0+\n\nRequires chef-client and a Chef Server - this cookbook doesn't make\nsense, nor work, with chef-solo.\n\nWorks on any platform.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n`node[:blacklist]` provides a map of node attributes to store. The\ndefaults are provided by this cookbook, and the map is:\n\n    node.default[:blacklist] = {\n    }\n\nThis cookbook honors the fact that attributes are set at different\nprecedence levels.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nUpload the cookbook, and make sure that it is included as a dependency\nin another cookbooks metadata, or that the recipe (which does nothing)\nis included in the role.\n\nWhenever node.save is called, such as at the end of the run, the\nblacklist will be applied.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Jon-Paul Sullivan (<jonpaul.sullivan@hp.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2013, Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.
