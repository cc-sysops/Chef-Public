clonezillalive Cookbook
=======================

Deploy Clonezilla-Live for network-booting.

Clonezilla then allows to save and restore images of hard-disks.

If the image is for windows and prepared for example with sysprep, it can be
used to install several machines over and over again.

Requirements
------------

The development of this cookbook happens on debian wheezy (7.1), which makes
this the supported platform.

#### cookbooks
 - `tftp`: For the booting
 - `nfs`: For the image store

Attributes
----------

[None yet]


Usage
-----
#### clonezillalive::default

This recipe does nothing. Its there to play it safe if I want to add providers
and resources to this cookbook.

#### clonezillalive::server

This recipe grabs the clonezilla live image and unpacks the files needed for
network-boot. Then it installs tftp and syslinux and configures pxe-booting for
the clonezilla image.
