  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n* Install the rsdns Rackspace Cloud DNS management scripts from github https://github.com/linickx/rsdns\n\n* Puts the scripts into /opt/rsdns, a symlink to the main rsdns script into /usr/local/bin so it's in the PATH, and creates a .rsdns_config file in /root with the username and api key to use\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* A Rackspace cloud server username and api key to use the rsdns scripts\n\n* If you want automatic credentials added to the rsdns commands for the root user, an encrypted data_bag named rackspace must be created with an item called cloud.  \n  * If you do not want to use the /root/.rsdns_config file to manage the credentials for root, skip the following section \n\n###Setting up the .raxrc file for automatic cloud login credentials for root\n####If you already have an encrypted_data_bag_secret file created and pushed out to your chef nodes\n* Create the new encrypted data_bag\nknife data bag create --secret-file <LOCATION/NAME OF SECRET FILE>  rackspace cloud\n\n* Make the json file opened look like the following, then save and exit your editor:\n{\n  \"id\": \"cloud\",\n  \"raxusername\": \"<YOUR CLOUD SERVER USERNAME\",\n  \"raxapikey\": \"<YOUR CLOUD SERVER API KEY\"\n}\n\n####If you are not currently using an encrypted_data_bag_secret file\n* Create a new secret file\nopenssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\\r\\n' > /tmp/my_data_bag_key\n\n* The /tmp/my_data_bag_key (or whatever you called it in the above step) needs to be pushed out to your chef nodes to /etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret\n\n* Create the new encrypted data_bag\nknife data bag create --secret-file /tmp/my_data_bag_key rackspace cloud\n\n* Make the json file opened look like the following, then save and exit your editor:\n{\n  \"id\": \"cloud\",\n  \"raxusername\": \"<YOUR CLOUD SERVER USERNAME\",\n  \"raxapikey\": \"<YOUR CLOUD SERVER API KEY\"\n}\n\nAttributes\n==========\nFrom encrypted data bag rackspace with item cloud:\n* ['raxusername']\n* ['raxapikey']\n\nUsage\n=====\n####Using the .rsdns_config file\n*Follow the steps under the Requirements section above to create the encrypted data bag for the .rsdns_config file\n* As root user you can manage your Rackspace Cloud DNS settings via the rsdns tools, see the description above for links to the documentation\n  * If you do not set the .rsdns_config credentials, or you want to use rsdns from a non-root user, you can still access the Rackspace Cloud DNS API by -u and -a options on your rsdns commands\n\n#### Not using the .rsdns_config file\n* Do not create the rackspace cloud encrypted databag item\n* Access the Rackspace Cloud DNS API by using the -u and -a options on your rsdns commands\n* Export the path to rsdns with \"export RSPATH=/opt/rsdns\", or add the export command to your .bash_profile\n",
