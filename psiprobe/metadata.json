  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nObtains and installs the Psi Probe war file in TomCat.\n\nSource code available here : https://github.com/FleetingClouds/chef-cookbook-psiprobe\n\n\nPreamble\n========\n\nThis is my first attempt at a simple Chef cookbook, so please expect some quirks.\n\nIt is only tested on TomCat 6, only as installed by the default TomCat Cookbook, and only on Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nIt uses more shell scripting than it should, where Ruby would probably be just as capable, if not more so.\n\nComments and pulls are encouraged, very much so, please.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nApplication\n-----------\n\n* TomCat 6 (tested)\n* Any other Tomcat understood by Psi Probe ought to be ok.\n\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\n* Ubuntu 11.04  (Tested)\n* Any other platform that supports TomCat ought to be ok.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIf you are using the default tomcat cookbook on Ubuntu you can run with the defaults.\n\nYou have the option to set the attribute  default[:psiprobe][:define_manager] = \"true\".  That will cause the recipe to edit the file tomcat-user.xml adding a \"manager\" role, if there is not one already, and adding a \"manager\" user you specify with   default[:psiprobe][:manager_uid]   and   default[:psiprobe][:manager_pwd]\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Martin \"Hasan\" Bramwell (<martinhbramwell (0) gmail o com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2012, FLEETING CLOUDS\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
