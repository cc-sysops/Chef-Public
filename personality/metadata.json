I have had a fair amount of external interest so I'm putting this out in the hopes that more people help make it more awesome. \n\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis cookbook currently relies on the excellent [`chef-rvm`](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm) cookbook from @fnichol and assumes a system-level `rvm` install. It would be great if this cookbook were totally standalone someday...\n\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe following platforms are supported by this cookbook, meaning that the recipes run on these platforms without error:\n\n* Ubuntu\n\n\n## Recipes\n\n* `personality` - The default recipe.\n\n# Usage\n\nThis cookbook sets up a file using the `update-motd.d` system. There's nothing to do beyond that.\n\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `default[\"personality\"][\"characters\"]` = \"default daemon eyes bong ghostbusters beavis.zen bud-frogs calvin cheese cock milk dragon dragon-and-cow elephant gnu head-in stegosaurus turtle tux\"\n\n\n## Basic Settings\n\nNone\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis cookbook could have way more personality...
