  "long_description": "## ChefPackage\n\nPackage resources for compile time installs\n\n### Reason\n\nIn some cases, generally now using the chef_gem resource, it is required\nto have system packages installed at compile time. This allows chef_gem\nto properly install gems that may have requirements for compiling libraries.\n\n### Special case\n\nUnlike the chef_gem package, there may be other resources depending on notifications\nfrom system packages since they are not segregated in the same manner as chef_gem.\nTo allow for this, when a chef_package resource is created, a dynamic package\nresource is also created, which will proxy the chef_package notifications to other\nresources depending on them.\n\n### Example\n\n```ruby\nchef_package 'tmux'\n\nruby_block 'tmux notification' do\n  block do\n    Chef::Log.info 'Package \"tmux\" was installed!'\n  end\n  action :nothing\n  subscribes :create, resources(:package => 'tmux'), :immediately\nend\n```\n\nDelayed notifications will be sent at the end of the run. Immediate notifications\nwill be sent at the start of the excute phase of the run. \n\n### Note about chef_package notifications\n\nJust like the existing ChefGem resource, the run_action is called directly against\nthe resource, not via the runner. This means that chef_package based resources\nwill not provide notifications.\n\n### Note about compatiblity\n\nThis cookbook is currently _only_ compatible with Chef >= 10.14.0\n\n## Infos\n* Repository: https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/chef_package\n",
