Should work on any version?\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node['yoke']['install']` - The Yoke version to install. Default 'ruby'. Values can be one of: php, python, ruby, node or all.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe default recipe will install the Ruby service. You can override this with the `node['yoke']['install']` attribute. See __Caveats__ below.\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nWhile Node is available to install, the recipe doesn't do the additional shell magic required to make it work. Manual steps may be necessary.\n\nWith the default hotkey, the Ruby service was failing to run. This is probably a bug upstream.\n\nThe recipe doesn't set any keyboard shortcuts automatically. The user defaults on OS X doesn't really make it easy to set shortcuts for Text services.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nCopyright:: 2011, Joshua Timberman <cookbooks@housepub.org>\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
