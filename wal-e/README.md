WAL-E Cookbook
==============

Installs and configures [WAL-E](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e) using
envdir to store configuration. Sets up a crontab entry to perform base
backups. You still need to configure Postgres manually/separately to
archive WAL files.

(Tested on Debian/Ubuntu only - will probably break on other
distributions.)
