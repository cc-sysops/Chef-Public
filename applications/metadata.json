This becomes the\ndefault provider for `package` if your platform is Mac OS X.\n\nAs this extends the built-in package resource/provider in Chef, it has\nall the resource attributes and actions available to the package\nresource. However, a couple notes:\n\n* Homebrew itself doesn't have a notion of \"upgrade\" per se. The\n  \"upgrade\" action will simply perform an install, and if the Homebrew\n  Formula for the package is newer, it will upgrade.\n* Likewise, Homebrew doesn't have a purge, but the \"purge\" action will\n  act like \"remove\".\n\n### Examples\n\n    package \"mysql\" do\n      action :install\n    end\n\n    homebrew_package \"mysql\"\n\n    package \"mysql\" do\n      provider Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew\n    end\n\n## homebrew\\_tap\n\nLWRP for `brew tap`, a Homebrew command used to add additional formula\nrepositories. From the `brew` man page:\n\n    tap [tap]\n           Tap a new formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps.\n\n           tap is of the form user/repo, e.g. brew tap homebrew/dupes.\n\nDefault action is `:tap` which enables the repository. Use `:untap` to\ndisable a tapped repository.\n\n### Examples\n\n    homebrew_tap \"homebrew/dupes\"\n\n    homebrew_tap \"homebrew/dupes\" do\n      action :untap\n    end\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write you change\n4. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass (with travis)\n5. Submit a Pull Request using Github\n",
